# Product list 
Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kateryna Khremuchkova, a passionate frontend developer from Ukraine. \
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## This project features:
- A login form with validation and error handling, storing the response token on successful submission.
- On login - the app shows a list of all product categories. 
- The user has the ability to drill down to a products list featuring all products from the selected category.
- Each product on the product list screen features an â€˜Add to cartâ€™ button and a pair of buttons to adjust item quantity activated after adding the item to cart.
- The number of current items contained in the cart is be visible on the category and product list pages at all times and reflects the
  underlying state.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
